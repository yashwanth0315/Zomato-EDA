**Project Title: Zomato EDA Insights**
This project involves a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing over 55,000 Zomato customer records. The objective was to clean and prepare the data, then extract meaningful insights about user behavior and restaurant patterns using visual analytics.

**Key Steps:**
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values using statistical imputation, merged semantically similar column entries, and standardized column names for better readability.
- Data Visualization: Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate plots highlighting online ordering trends, cuisine popularity, ratings distribution, vote volumes, price ranges, booking preferences, and restaurant types.

**Insights Uncovered:**
- Certain cuisines tend to receive higher ratings and booking frequencies.
- Customers show stronger engagement with restaurants that support online ordering.
- Price ranges and vote counts vary significantly across restaurant types and regions.
This project demonstrates proficiency in preprocessing, visual storytelling, and deriving business-friendly insights through Python. It's ideal for showcasing data wrangling and presentation skills with real-world relevance.
